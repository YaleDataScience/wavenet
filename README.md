# YDS Project : audio processing 

Impelementation of audio processing related models

**Note**: 
- For those who are interested in this project, please read [this post]() first. It describes basic stuff you need to know to do audio processing.

- Then, read the following two papers.

## Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Network

We can probably use this model to generate raw audio, instead of handwriting sequences.
